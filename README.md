# Trillo
This is a course project I built as part of Advanced CSS and SASS. Site is coded exclusively in HTML, CSS, and SASS. No Javascript is present.  Features include a Flexbox layout, sidebar navigation, SVG icons, button animations, and five media query breakpoints.  The design incorporates Tailwind colors with html entities.
